# PHP Project with MVC and Custom Enhancements

This project started as a learning exercise from the [Laracasts PHP for Beginners course](https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners-2023-edition), and has since been expanded with additional features and refactoring to its structure and functionality.

## Overview

- **Models**: Introduced model classes to handle data interactions, making the project more aligned with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.
- **Form Handling**: Created a reusable form class to streamline validation and error handling across the application.
- **Refactored Flows**:
  - **Notes Management**: Improved the logic for managing notes, adding more data validation and code organization.
  - **User Handling**: Expanded user-related functionality, including session management and user data retrieval.
  - **Registration Flow**: Refined the registration process to enhance security and user experience.
  - **CSRF Flow**: Added CSRF protection to forms which is checked via middleware and will regenerate the token upon registration and login.
